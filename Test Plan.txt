and Book Management API.

2. SCOPE: 
	i) What to include:
	- User Registration
		- Testing of all form fields
		- Validating all form fields rules
		- Verify all error messages
		
	- User Login:
		- Testing with all valid/invalid credentials
		- Verify all error messages
		- Verify session management
		
	- User Dashboard:
		- Verify all test data should display
		- Verify user interaction and navigation
		
	- Book Management API:
		- Adding a Book: Test with valid and invalid inputs.
		- Retrieving a Book: Test with valid and invalid book IDs.
		- Updating Book Details: Test with valid and invalid data.
		- Deleting a Book: Test with valid and invalid book IDs.
	
	ii) Test Environment:

	- Developers: ABC1, ABC2
	- Project Manager: ABC

4. DELIVERABLES:
	- Test plan
	- Test cases
	- Bug Report
	- Requirement Traceability Matrix

5. TEST SCHEDULE:
	- Test starting date:
	- Test ending date:
	- Internal availability:
	- General availability:
	- Release date:
	
6. TOOLS:
	- Excel, Xray, Confluence, Jira, Eclipse
	
7. RISKS AND MITIGATION:
	i) Risk- Suppose in mid of testing a team member can leave for long time in an emergency.
	   Mitigation- So we need to replace the person with other immediately. Or distribute the work with other team members who has more 
	      bandwidth. So that deadlines would not be imapacted.
	ii) Risk: Poor navigation, confusing layout, or usability issues could result in customer frustration and reduced sales.
	    Mitigation: Conduct usability testing with real users to identify interface problems. Gather feedback and iterate on design improvements
		before deployment. Ensure consistency across different devices and browsers.

8. Test Criteria:-
	i) Tests pass if all scenarios execute without critical defects impacting the seat selection process.
	ii) Minor issues (e.g., UI inconsistencies) may be logged for future enhancements.
